## üöÄ Key Components

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Visualization**
   - Detection and replacement of outliers using robust STL decomposition.
   - Comparison of original and cleaned series to evaluate the impact of anomalies (e.g., COVID-19 disruptions).

### 2. **Time Series Decomposition**
   - Application of STL decomposition to isolate trend, seasonality, and residuals.
   - Quantification of the strength of trend and seasonality components.

### 3. **Forecasting Models**
   - **Benchmark Models**: Includes naive, seasonal naive, mean, and drift methods.
   - **Smoothing Splines**: Implementation of cubic smoothing splines to capture complex trends.
   - **Multiple Linear Regression**: Incorporates additional macroeconomic indicators like exports, imports, and inflation for forecasting GDP.

### 4. **Residual Analysis**
   - Assessment of residuals for normality, autocorrelation, and variance.
   - Validation of model assumptions for reliable forecasting.
